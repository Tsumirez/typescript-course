Source maps.

    // "sourceMap": true,                      Generates corresponding '.map' file.
    
Set this to true and sourcemaps will be created for compiled .ts files
These allow browser's devtools (least chrome ones) to access typescript files and debug them.
Normally these would not be accessible to the browser, only their end result .js files.
